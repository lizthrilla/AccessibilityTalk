# How Not to Get Sued*: Accessibility in 2018

*TargetAudience:* All Developers regardless of experience, language or framework.

*Abstract*:
We talk about accessibility, but how many developers are actually working to make apps and sites accessible?  Sadly, not nearly enough.  Accessibility is something every developer should be working towards, but many find the information overwhelming and, ironically, inaccessibile.  With this presentation, Liz will demystify web and mobile accessibility, while also empowering developers to make their projects accessible immediately.  This presentation is language and framework agnostic, and takes a holistic look as to why accessibility should be something that concerns every single developer.  In this session, you will learn why accessibility is your responsibility, that making your project accessible is much easier than you anticipate, and, most importantly, how not to get sued.*
